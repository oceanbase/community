# OceanBase Community Partners

[中文版](README_CN.md)

OceanBase community ecological partners are part of the [OceanBase Partner Network](https://www.oceanbase.com/partner). According to the type of partners, they can be divided into community solution partners and community product ecological partners.

### Community Solution Partners

OceanBase community solution partners refer to ecological partners that have been tested to be compatible with OceanBase Community Edition, have passed the compatibility certification, and obtained the certificate. The current certification process for OceanBase Community Edition is as follows:
1. Fill in the red part in [Test Report Template](template/OceanBase数据库社区版&XXXX联合解决方案测试报告.docx).
2. Fill in the red part in [Certificate Template](template/OceanBase数据库社区版&XXXX互认证书.pptx).
3. Reply in [Who is using OceanBase](https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase/issues/1301) (Either Chinese or English is acceptable).
4. After completing the above operations, contact the OceanBase team through the community’s [Contact Information](https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase?tab=readme-ov-file#community) and submit the test report and certificate draft.
5. After passing the review by the OceanBase team, we can go on the electronically signing workflow.
6. After the signing workflow is completed, we will update the newly certified solution to the [Solution Partner List Page](https://www.oceanbase.com/partner/solution).
